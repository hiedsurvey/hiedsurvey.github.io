# High Education Research Survey


## About the survey 

Our team of researchers would like to ask you some questions for a research project that we are conducting on intellectual freedom around the world. The investigators are Professors Matthew Goodwin, Harold Clarke and Dr Karl Ho. Your responses are anonymous. The data will be used for an academic article and research report. The survey should take you no more than 10-12 minutes to complete and we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time and participation in our research project.
